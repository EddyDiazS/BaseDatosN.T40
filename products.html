                            <br> <b>System Integration:</b> Cloud computing involves the integration of various hardware, software, networking, and storage components to provide on-demand services over the internet. Systems engineers play a crucial role in designing, implementing, and maintaining these integrated cloud systems to ensure seamless operation and optimal performance.
                            
                            <br> <b>System Architecture:</b> Cloud computing relies on a robust system architecture to deliver services efficiently and securely. Systems engineers are responsible for designing the architecture of cloud systems, including data centers, virtualization methods, and network infrastructure, to meet the requirements of users and applications.
                            
                            <br> <b>System Scalability:</b> Cloud computing offers scalability, allowing users to scale resources up or down based on demand. Systems engineers need to design cloud systems that can dynamically adjust resources to accommodate varying workloads while maintaining performance and reliability.
                            
                            <br> <b>System Security:</b> Data security and confidentiality are critical aspects of cloud computing. Systems engineers need to implement robust security measures, such as data encryption, access controls, and distributed data storage, to protect sensitive information stored in the cloud from unauthorized access or cyber threats.
                            
                            <br> <b>System Optimization:</b> Systems engineers are involved in optimizing cloud systems for performance, cost-efficiency, and resource utilization. They analyze system metrics, monitor performance, and make adjustments to ensure that cloud services meet the needs of users effectively.
